The <a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/latex-tutorial/">L<sub>A</sub>T<sup>E</sup>X for Undergraduates</a> tutorial has been resurrected and all of the broken links should be fixed on this domain. The tutorial describes the typesetting system in a way that can be taught in classrooms alongside another curriculum. The original tutorial was taught at Drake University's freshman math seminar course.
